Welcome to my **AlgoJourney repository**! 🚀  

This is my personal space for **daily Codeforces problem-solving**, tracking my progress, and refining my problem-solving skills in algorithms and data structures.

---

## About
This repository is dedicated to my **daily practice on Codeforces**. Each day, I attempt a new problem, solve it in my preferred language, and document my solution along with a brief explanation.  

Goals of this repo:  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills  
- Track my daily progress  
- Build a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures  

---

## Structure
Each challenge is organized as follows:

- **Date:** When I solved the problem  
- **Problem Title:** Name of the problem with a link to Codeforces  
- **Solution:** My Java code implementation
- **Explanation:** A short summary of my approach and logic
